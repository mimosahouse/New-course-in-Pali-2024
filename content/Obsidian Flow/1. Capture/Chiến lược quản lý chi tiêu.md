| _50/30/20 method_                   | Each month, you allocate your after-tax income into three buckets:  <br>  <br>1. 50%: Needs (housing, groceries, utilities, minimum debt payments)   <br>2. 30%: "Wants" (gym memberships, streaming subscriptions, eating out, vacations)  <br>3. 20%: Savings (cash reserve, retirement)                                                           | Those who are looking for a simple way to balance spending and savings priorities.               | An expense management strategy that can be used on its own or as a starting point for other budgeting approaches. |
| _“Pay yourself     first” strategy_ | 1. Decide how much of your income you want to save each month.  <br>2. “Pay yourself first” by automatically routing a portion of each paycheck into your savings or retirement funds.  <br>3. Pay for essential expenses.  <br>4. Whatever is left over to cover discretionary spending.                                                            | Those looking to reach certain savings goals and reducing their spending on non-essential items. | Emphasizes savings rather than expenses.                                                                          |
| _Envelope system_                   | 1. Set a limit for each spending category.  <br>2. Fill envelopes with the allotted amount. This can also be done virtually.  <br>3. Use the money from each category to pay for monthly expenses.  <br>4. Once that money is gone, you can’t spend any more on that category for the month – or you need to reallocate funds from another category. | Those prone to overspending or   impulse purchasing.                                             | Draws attention to excessive spending on any one item or category.                                                |
| _Zero-based   approach_             | 1. At the start of the month, allocate every single dollar of income toward a specific purpose and various categories, including short- and long-term savings and debt payments.  <br>2. Track and categorize each expense throughout the month.  <br>3. By the month’s end, subtract your expenditures from your income. The total should be zero.  | Those looking to understand and   control their spending habits.                                 | Offers a highly detailed look at where your money goes each month.                                                |
